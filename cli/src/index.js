CliCommand.description = `üêÜ Runs GitHub Actions workflows locally for testing

To see wflow in action, try this:

  wflow

Likely you'll want to run your own workflow. Try this:

  wflow --file workflows/parallel.yml

Sometimes you just want to test a single job. Well then!

  wflow --file workflows/parallel.yml --job job1

If you don't specify an --event, it attempts to create an event from your .git directory.

An event is analogous to a GitHub webhook payload.

All of the above should open up a browser, so you can have some realtime enjoyment.
