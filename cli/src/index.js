To see wflow in action, try this:

  wflow

Likely you'll want to run your own workflow. Try this:

  wflow --file workflows/parallel.yml

Sometimes you just want to test a single job. Well then!

  wflow --file workflows/parallel.yml --job job1

All of the above should open up a browser, so you can have some realtime enjoyment.
